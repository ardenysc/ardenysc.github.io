# Personal Website

[ardenysc.github.io](https://ardenysc.github.io)

### Description
My personal website. I took an HTML template and migrated it to React, made some design changes, and added features such as project cards, tech skill chips, and a functioning contact form. Since personal websites are not frequently updated, I opted to deploy the website using Gatsby and GitHub pages.
